# STAT545A Mini Data Analysis Milestone 1
## Torin Halvorson

This repository was created for the Mini Data Analysis Milestone 1, as part of the STAT545A course. The primary objective was to leverage ggplot2 and dplyr functions to visualize and manipulate semi-tidy datasets from the `datateachr` package.

The repository contains the following files:

1. README.md
   - a brief description of the project

2. 20231002_MiniDataAnalysis1.Rmd
   - The source Rmd file for the project
   - Explores several datasets from the `datateachr` package, including a detailed exploratory analysis of the `cancer_samples` dataset using dplyr and ggplot2

3. 20231002_MiniDataAnalysis1.md
   - The output of 20231002_MiniDataAnalysis1.Rmd and the key deliverable for this milestone

4. 20231002_MiniDataAnalysis1_files
   - This folder contains the .png image files that were generated automatically when knitting the Rmd file
   - This is a good resource to view the output graphs in more detail
